# `use-epics`

## Why?

If you like handling side-effects with [redux-observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable) and [rxjs](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJS), but want to do so more simply with a useReducer hook instead of redux, this is for you. Epics are combined with the simplicity of [use-methods](https://github.com/pelotom/use-methods), absctracting away useReducer into simple actions (reminiscent of `hyperapp`) and adding in `immer`. If you only want the actions without the epics, install `use-methods` instead.

## Getting started

```
npm install use-epics
```
